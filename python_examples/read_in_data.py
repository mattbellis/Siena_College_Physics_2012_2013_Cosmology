# This is a very fast way of reading in a text file, when
# you know how the data is formatted, e.g. how many columns
# there are.
# 
# Depending on the size of the file, this still may take some time (~5-20 sec),
# but is still faster than other traditional ways of reading in files.
#
# The trade-off is that this method works best when you have a good amount of 
# memory (RAM) available.
